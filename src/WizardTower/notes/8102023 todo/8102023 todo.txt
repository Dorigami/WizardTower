how money/xp will work
	- The player has a set amount of money to start the match and will get money for defeating enemies.
	- There there is only one resource used to purchase and upgrade the player's towers/units
	- No persistent leveling across sessions

function NodeCollision(_node){

	// this function will check if the node is blocked or not walkable and will push the entity to the nearest edge of the given node
	if(is_undefined(_node)) || (!is_instanceof(_node, global.iEngine.Node))
	{
		show_debug_message("Cannot run node collision: node doesn't exist");

	var dy = position[2] - _node.y;
