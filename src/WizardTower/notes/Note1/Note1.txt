WIZARD TOWER PROTOTYPING

THINGS TO BUILD & THEIR PRIORITY

1) game object that initializes display and grid space
2) copy unit selection code from previous projects (buildings cannot be selected, for simplicity's sake)
3) create a pEntity which will have child parents pUnit, pBuilding, & pResource  // to be used by the player's units as well as enemy units
4) add the wizard unit that allows for selection (give parent a bool indicating selectability).  Do Not Animate!
5) create a building parent
6) add the nexus & the hut building in order to spawn the wizards.  Do Not Animate!
7) implement A* pathing from that tutorial
8) enforce minimum distance between wizards
9) create the "imp" enemy that moves toward the nexus, but attacks wizards that get too close.  Do Not Animate!
10) add trees that grow over time and can be exploited for mana by the wizards
11) add attacks & damage dealing for the wizards and imps
12) add placeholders for the other buildings available to the player
13) add button/hotkey to command selected wizards to conjure specified buildings
14) add placeholders for the enemies available to spawn
15) add the spawn beacon object that will define enemy spawn locations for each map
16) make sound effects for commanding, building, attacking (i will also need a generic "puff" sound)
17) make a senario editor to set enemy spawns and spawn locations. as well as starting buildings and mana for the player
18) tilemap setup to set terrain penalties (maybe)

pEntity = {
	immortal = false;
	selectable = false;
	path = -1;
	stats = {
		health : 1,
		mspeed : 1, // move speed 
		aspeed : 1, // attack speed
		power : 1
	}
	hp = stats.health;
}
